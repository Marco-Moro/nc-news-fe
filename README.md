# NC News - Frontend

https://nc-news-marco.netlify.app

## Project Overview

This is the **frontend** for the NC News project, built using **JavaScript**, **React**, **React Router**, and **Vite**. It consumes the RESTful API created in the backend and allows users to:

- View a list of articles
- View a single article and its comments
- Post new comments
- Vote on articles and comments
- Delete their own comments
- Filter articles by topic
- Sort articles by date, votes, and comment count
- Navigate via client-side routing (React Router)
- Handle all errors and invalid URLs gracefully
